# rrails

This package provides a new pipe operator, `%>>=` (pronounced "bind") for
writing failure-tolerant R code. Its approach is inspired by Scott Wlaschin's
articles and talks about ["Railroad Oriented Programming"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/) in
in the F# language.

## Installation

**rrails** is not yet available on CRAN, so for now you'll have to install it
from GitHub:


```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("atheriel/rrails")
```
