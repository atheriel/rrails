Description: A pipe operator '%>>=%' (pronounced "bind") and a 'result' S3 class
    for creating failure-tolerant code. Its approach is inspired by Scott
    Wlaschin's writing on "Railroad Oriented Programming" in 'F#'
    <https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/rop/>, as well as the error-handling
    paradigms of 'Rust' and 'Haskell'.
